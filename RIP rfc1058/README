RFC 1058 == RIP: routing information protocol
It is a protocol for exchanging routing information between routers.

My program will first initilize processes representing nodes(routers), then they will start to exchange routing information. RIP is distance-vector routing protocol, basically it means each router tell its neighbors what is the world in its perspective. 

Each node use such information to calculate routing table, which will serve for ensuing packet routing.

The program has to handle exceptions like node goes down and reappears for robust routing service.
