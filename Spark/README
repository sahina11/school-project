The project serves three purposes(sorted from application level to hardware level):
  1. Intro level understanding of imagenet contest by implement image classifier using Naive Bayes algorithm.
    - the reason to choose such ML algorithm is because it's very easy to understand and implement. And Spark MLlib already has some tools implemented.
  2. Learn to use Spark on a cluster to do distributed processing. 
  3. Learn how to use Amazon AWS to create a cloud cluster.
