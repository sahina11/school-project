In this game, beads of the same color that touch each other vertically or horizontally (but NOT diagonally) are considered a group. Any group can be removed from the board during a move while single beads cannot. When a group is removed, all of the beads supported by the group drop down as far as possible in their respective columns.

Whenever a gropu IS being removed, there is a score comes with it. The larger the group is, the bigger the score. 

So the first part of this LISP program is to allow user interactively play the game and the system will perform right, calculating accomapy scores and detect end of game.

Second part is to install intelligence into program, which means the program could be able to choose each step automatically, and the goal is to maximize the final score.
