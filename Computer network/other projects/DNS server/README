In this project,

First I will launch a DNS server process, which will listen to clients' message and process their requests.
The server only perform two function: remember Domain:IP mapping, and respond to queries.

Second, two kinds of client could be launched:
	1. register client: provide Domain:IP information and register it into server
	2. query client: provide Domain name to server, and expected correct IP in response.

This is my first project dealing with socket programming. What's good for my learning purpose is that I have to use low level language,C, to implement how process communicate with each other through sockets.
