\f0\fs24 \cf0 In this project, \
\
First I create a DNS server program, which will listen to client and process their requests. \
The server only perform two function: remember Domain:IP mapping, and respond to query.\
\
Second, two kinds of client\
	1. register client: provide Domain:IP information and register it into server\
	2. query client: provide Domain name to server, and expected correct IP in response.\
\
This is my first project dealing with socket programming. Especially good for learning purpose is that use low level language as C to implement this easy model taught me a lot about how process could communicate with each other through internet socket. \
