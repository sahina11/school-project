In this project, a topology of sensors and data aggregation points are defined.
First the program has to parse the input setup file to create the simulation background.

Each sensor has its own energy capacity. The purpose of sensor network is to propagate sensing data to access point. To do so, we need a path to route the data. To deice which path to route data, not only shortest path is important, but energy capacity bottleneck on the path need to be considered too.

For example, sensor 'a' finds a shortest path to AS (a > b > c > d > e > AS). If 'c' in the path is running out of battery life, choosing this path to route the data will deplete c's energy totally, so we need to find another path without c getting involved so that we could keep every sensor alive as long as possible.
